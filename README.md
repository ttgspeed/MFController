MFController
============

Controls a Mass Fabricator paired with an MFSU in Minecraft FTB 1.1.7

Required:

  1. CC Computer
  
  2. Redstone breaker (Sticky piston, redstone torch)
  
  3. Line from MFSU to Mass Fab, with EU splitter in between

How to make it work:

  1. Configure the MFSU to output redstone when full. 

  2. Run redstone from MFSU to right side of computer.

  3. Run redstone from left side of computer to breaker piston
  
  4. Run program
  
Note:
  
  You may need to updating the timining. It's currently set for a 15 minute cycle,
  which will drain a full MFSU to 1M EU, however, this depends on how much power is being put into the MFSU.
